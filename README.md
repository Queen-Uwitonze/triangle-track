 TRIANGLE TRACKER.
 ...
## Project description.
...
I will be building an application that will help us know whether a triangle is isosceles(when it has two eqwals sides or angles), equilateral(when it has three equals sides or angles), scalene(when sides or angles are not equals) or NOT a triangle at all.

## Setup instructions - includes any scripts that need to be run if necessary.
i used google chrome and edit textor(like visual code.)

## BDD.
As a user,if you want to enter the length values of the three sides of the triangle in the application,and after submitting the values, the application should tell you what type of triangle the values will produce, whether an isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NO triangle at all.
