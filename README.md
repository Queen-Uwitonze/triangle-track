|   Behavior                          |    Input     |   Output          |
| :-------------                      | :----------: | -----------:      |
| when i put in equal number,
  it'll say the triangle is 
  equirateral.                        | 60,60,60     | Equirateral       |
| when i put in two equal 
  number and the third one is 
  different,it'll say the triangle
   is isoscelene.                     | 45,45,90     | isoscelene       | 
| when i put in different number,      
  it'll say the triangle is 
  scalene.                            | 50,70,60     | Scalene           |
| when i put in 0 in one of 
  as number angles or sides,it'll say
  the triangle is not existed.        | 89,11,0      | not a triangle   \|
